Objective

To create a well-organized project structure in the CASE tool for modeling and managing UML diagrams of the Blood Bank Management System.

CASE Tool Used

StarUML

Project Structure Description

A structured project hierarchy was created in StarUML to organize all UML diagrams related to the system. This structure ensures clarity, easy navigation, and effective collaboration among team members.

1. Model Layer

Use Case Model

Administrator Use Case Diagram

Hospital Staff Use Case Diagram

Authorized Staff Use Case Diagram

Sequence Diagrams

Activity Diagrams (optional)

2. Diagram Organization

Each diagram is named clearly based on its functionality

Diagrams are grouped logically under appropriate model sections

Naming conventions are followed for consistency

Example:

UC_Admin_BBMS

UC_HospitalStaff_BBMS

ClassDiagram_BBMS

Sequence_BloodRequest

3. Access and Maintenance

The project structure is maintained within a single StarUML project file

Changes are reviewed before finalizing

Only approved diagrams are included in documentation

Benefits of Structured Project Organization
