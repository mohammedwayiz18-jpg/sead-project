1. Architectural Design Decision
Chosen Architecture: Layered Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture consisting of:

Presentation Layer (User Interface)

Business Logic Layer

Data Access Layer (Database)

Reason for Selection

Ensures separation of concerns

Makes the system easy to maintain and extend

Supports modular development and testing

2. Component-Based Design

The system is divided into independent components:

Authentication Component

Blood Bank Management Component

Inventory Management Component

Reporting Component

Justification

Improves reusability

Enables parallel development by team members

Reduces system complexity

3. Database Design Decision
Chosen Database Type: Relational Database

Key tables include:

Donor

Blood Inventory

Blood Requests

User Accounts

Reason for Selection

Ensures data consistency and integrity

Supports structured healthcare data

Easy to query and report

4. Security Design Decisions
Implemented Measures

Role-based access control (Admin, Staff, Donor)

Secure authentication and authorization

Restricted database access

Reason

Protect sensitive donor and patient data

Prevent unauthorized system usage

Comply with healthcare data handling norms

5. Decision Handling & Exception Management
Design Choices

Use of alternative flows in sequence diagrams

Validation at both UI and controller levels

Graceful error messages

Benefits

Improves system reliability

Enhances user experience

Prevents incorrect data entry

6. Scalability and Performance Considerations
Design Approach

Modular components

Separate application and database servers

Efficient inventory management

Benefits

Supports increasing number of users

Handles emergency blood requests efficiently

7. Usability Design Decisions
Design Focus

Simple and intuitive UI

Minimal steps for critical actions

Clear notifications and confirmations

Reason

Ensures ease of use for non-technical users

Reduces operational errors

8. Maintainability & Future Enhancements
Design Considerations

Modular architecture

Clear documentation

Standard UML diagrams

Future Scope

Mobile application integration

National-level blood bank integration

Automated donor notifications

Conclusion

The design decisions made for the Blood Bank Management System ensure a secure, scalable, and user-friendly system. The architecture and components were carefully chosen to support efficient blood bank operations, reduce manual errors, and provide timely support during emergencies.
