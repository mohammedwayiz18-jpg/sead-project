Objective

To set up a shared team workspace for collaborative modeling using a CASE tool for the Blood Bank Management System project.

Selected CASE Tool

StarUML

Workspace Setup Description
1. Workspace Creation

A centralized project workspace was created using StarUML.

A new project file named Blood_Bank_Management_System.mdj was created.

The project file contains all UML diagrams related to the system.

2. Team Collaboration Setup

The project workspace was shared among team members using a common platform such as:

Google Drive / GitHub / Local Shared Folder

All team members were given access to the workspace file to view and update diagrams.

3. Version Control Practice

Team members follow a controlled update process:

Only one member edits the StarUML file at a time

After modification, the updated file is shared with the team

File versions are saved with date or version numbers to avoid conflicts

Example:
BBMS_StarUML_v1.mdj
BBMS_StarUML_v2.mdj

4. Roles in Workspace Usage

Lead Developer (K. Wayiz): Creates and updates class and sequence diagrams

Documentation Lead (G. Harika): Exports diagrams and includes them in SRS

QA Lead (B. Akash): Reviews diagrams for correctness and completeness

Project Manager (C. Sai Pavan): Coordinates updates and approves changes

5. Diagram Organization

The workspace contains:

Use Case Diagrams

Class Diagrams

Sequence Diagrams

Each diagram is named clearly and stored within the same project file.

Tools & Environment

CASE Tool: StarUML

Collaboration Platform: Google Drive / GitHub

Operating System: Windows

File Format: .mdj

Conclusion

A shared team workspace was successfully set up using the CASE tool. This enabled effective collaboration, consistent diagram development, and smooth integration of UML artifacts into the project documentation.
